                <li>ALFALEUS TECHNOLOGY</li>
                <p>Currently working here as a Unity Developer. Here, we work on developing a product to aid people with
                    low vision. Low vision is a vision loss which can not be corrected with glasses, contacts or
                    surgery.
                    It doesn't mean complete blindness as light still remains.
                    We are making a product to help people with such disability and work normally in their day to day
                    lives.
                    We are using a VR headset (Pico G2 4KE) and adjusting the enviornment in such a way that it suits
                    the patient.

                <li>VIFR</li>
                <p>Worked for 2 months at VIFR on project HALARA. Their motto is to make VR games for autistic kids
                    to
                    help them understand better.<br>We made total of 10 modules of which 4 were made entirely be me.
                    From core mechanics to game implementation.<br>
                    Using all the concepts like raycasting, XR-Rig, Trigger and collision events and even learning the
                    PXR Manager,
                    XR-input management system using Tobii initializer.
                    I also learnt 3-D Modeling through this internship and applied it in few of their projects. The
                    overall experience was really fun and fruitful and now apply that knowledge in
                    my
                    games.
