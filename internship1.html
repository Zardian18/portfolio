                <p>Worked for 2 months at VIFR on project HALARA. Their motto is to make VR games for autistic kids
                    to
                    help them understand better.<br>We made total of 10 modules of which 4 were made entirely be me.
                    From core mechanics to game implementation.<br>
                    Using all the concepts like raycasting, XR-Rig, Trigger and collision events and even learning the
                    PXR Manager,
                    XR-input management system using Tobii initializer.
                    I also learnt 3-D Modeling through this internship and applied it in few of their projects. The
                    overall experience was really fun and fruitful and now apply that knowledge in
                    my
                    games.
